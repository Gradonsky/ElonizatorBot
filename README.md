##### The most amazing Bot for Elon Musk Tweets

This bot was created to track Elon Musk Twitter Account.
Whenever he tweets about dogecoin the Bot is passing order to 3Commas where a decent amount of money is pumped into the crypto, to get even more üí∞üí∞üí∞.
Depending on your settings I recommend you to use the Trailing Mode on 3Commas so whenever the pump reverses more than ex.0.5% from the highest point, the bot automatically sells. (watch out for the fluctuation)

The Bot will notify you over Telegram whenever Elon Tweets something and also notify you if he found something related to "Doge" in his tweet.

## How to
1. Create a Twitter account and obtain the API Key
2. Create an account on Binance and get the API key
3. Create a free account on 3Commas, create your own bot there and get the API key
4. Create your own bot with BotFather on Telegram, get the API key - [Telegram Tutorial](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)
5. Now invite your Custom Bot from Botfather into a group and grab the Group Chat ID - [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423837/telegram-bot-how-to-get-a-group-chat-id)
5. Put all API Keys and the Group Chat ID into config.json
7. Install the requirements over pip and start the TwitterListener.py script.

_The List of the Keywords can be adjusted in the TwitterListener file._

By using this command in telegram you can check the uptime of the bot:
```
/uptime
```
## Docker?
Just build the docker image with the Dockerfile which is included in the Repo.
